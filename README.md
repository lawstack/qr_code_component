## My process

- Analyse and understand what you’re going to build, who it’s for, and what its purpose is.
- Experimenting with the code to achieve the desired outcome through trial and error. 
- Researching code examples or real-world implementations online for reference.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

Center an element with simple css code

```css
.element {
  width : 80%;
  margin : auto;
}
```

Using html tags like

```html
<h2>Some text</h2> heading
<p>Some text</p> paragraph
<div>html elements</div> used as a container
```

### Continued development

- Enhance responsiveness to ensure the layout adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes and web browsers.
- Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to build a flexible, adaptable layout structure.
- Apply relative font sizing (e.g., em, rem, or viewport units) so text scales proportionally with the browser’s dimensions.

### Useful resources

- The resources available at https://www.w3schools.com/ are excellent. They provide clear, beginner-friendly explanations, making them ideal for those new to web development. You can learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even React through their tutorials.
